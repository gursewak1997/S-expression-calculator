# S-expression-calculator
A command line program that acts as a simple calculator: it takes a single argument as an expression and prints out the integer result of evaluating it.

Assuming the program is implemented in Python, invocations should look like:

    $ ./calc.py 123
    123

    $ ./calc.py "(add 12 12)"
    24
